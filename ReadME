Purpose of this project was to explore real-world interference to effect the virtual world in minecraft. In this instance I'm using color data gathered from a color sensor to spawn animals and misc. elements in to the minecraft world.

Parts
-Arduino
-ColorPal color sensor
-Laptop (MacbookPro)
-Minecraft

Will link a video soon demonstrating the findings and results.
